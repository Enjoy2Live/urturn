Eventually the last Semantle Battle will be between two large teams.\\n- Only the team leader can type in guesses. Teams will not have access to the other teams voice chat/text channel.\\n\\n#### Prizes\\n\\n- Team leader of last team standing gets the only ultimate tournament winner discord role.\\n- Players on the winning team will get a tournament winner discord role.\\n\\n#### Rules\\n\\n- No Cheating of any form (you will be disqualified immediately, banned from the discord server, and the UrTurn platform - seriously don\'t ruin the fun of others).\\n- The winner is chosen based on the player in this order of priority:\\n  - player who guessed the word first\\n  - closest word index-wise (e.g. 99th word in nearest list is better than 70th word in nearest list)\\n  - closest word similarity score-wise\\n- Each game you have 30 seconds to provide your secret and 5 minutes to guess the other player\'s secret. At the end of the 5 minutes, a winner is chosen."},{"id":"First Game Jam","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/First Game Jam","editUrl":"https://github.com/turnbasedgames/urturn/tree/main/docs/blog/2022-08-06-first-game-jam/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-08-06-first-game-jam/index.md","title":"First Game Jam (08/06/2022)","description":"Update","date":"2022-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"game jam","permalink":"/blog/tags/game-jam"}],"readingTime":0.62,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Tang","title":"Developer @ UrTurn","url":"https://github.com/kevo1ution","imageURL":"https://github.com/kevo1ution.png","key":"kevo1ution"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"First Game Jam","title":"First Game Jam (08/06/2022)","authors":["kevo1ution"],"tags":["game jam"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Semantle Battle Tournament (11/5/2022)","permalink":"/blog/Semantle Battle Tournament"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"## Update\\n\\nCongratulations to the winners!!\\n\\n- **1st Place** - `@ReverendPazu , no name`\\n- **2nd Place** - `@azzy made rock paper scissors (no bugs edition)`\\n- **3rd place** - `@Flakezzz1 made connect 4`\\n\\n## Prompt\\n\\n> Every Great Journey has a beginning.
